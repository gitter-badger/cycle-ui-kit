Cycle UI Kit is a project aimed at making a common set of 
skinnable, reusable components for use in Cycle.js apps.
Skins such as Material Design, Flat UI and other designs
will be developed in tandem with the library, allowing you to
pick and choose skins to go along with the plain components.

## Goals

* Create a set of clean, isolated, resuable, skinnable, composable set of Cycle.js components which can be used with minimal effort from the developer.
* Adhere to best practices and set an easy-to-use and intuitive pattern for writing skinnable, reusable and composable Cycle.js components.
* Create as many skins as possible for the components, allow for the community to foster around making such skins as standalone projects.
